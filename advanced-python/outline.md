# Outline

### Why Python?
* Second most popular programming language in the world
* Useful for data analysis
* Faster than JavaScript

### Python REPL

```bash
# launch the REPL
python3
```

### Comments and Writing to Standard Out

```py
# single line comment

"""
A multiline comment
is actually a multiline string
that Python reads
and then ignores :)
"""
```

```py
# equivalent to console.log; can accept multiple arguments
print('hello world')
```

### Variables

```py
# no const or let needed
num = 5

# variables are mutable
num = 10

# strings can be single or double quote
name = 'Alice'
name = "Bob"

# booleans start with a capital
hungry = False
```
