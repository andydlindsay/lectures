### To Do

* [ ] Project Management
* [ ] Planning out a project
* [ ] Keeping track of tasks
* [ ] Keeping track of time
* [ ] Staying organized

### Project Management

#### Waterfall

* A more "traditional" approach
* You quote and plan the project all at once and are set to that plan
* Each piece is worked on one at a time to ultimately launch the project at-once
* This could mean: discovery, design, wireframing, ERD, database, then back-end, then front-end, then styling, then a testing / fixes period
* Prone to roadblocks
* More solid initial planning
* Less flexible during development

#### Waterfall Release Schedule

#### Agile

* Iterative approach
* Dynamic
* Designed to deliver a product in smaller, faster "stages" / "sprints"
  * Sprints are defined periods of time (ex: 2 weeks) that a feature must be completed to a launch-ready point
* Each step of the way the progress and plan are re-evaluated and changes can be scheduled
* Has an emphasis on:
  * Individuals / interactions over processes and tools
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  * Responding to change over following a set plan

#### Scrum

* Product Backlog
  * A living document, an ordered list of what is needed to improve the topic
  * This defines the goals and work of the scrum team to reach the product goal
* Sprint Backlog
  * The list of deliverables / tasks necessary to fulfill items in the product backlog
  * Organized into groups that are deliverable within sprint-periods / sprints
* Sprint Planning
  * Why is the Sprint valuable?
  * What can be done during this sprint?
  * How will this get done, and by whom?
  * Set timeframe
* Sprint Execution
  * No changes can be made that endanger the sprint and its goals
  * Quality of the product can not decrease
  * Product backlog can be updated to reflect this development
  * Scope is clarified with the product owner as more is learned
  * Must complete within the agreed upon timeframe, all members are accountable and help each other
* Sprint Review
  * Look over the outcome of the sprint
  * Identify any adjustments or future developments that can improve it over time
  * Identify anything in the development process that hindered, or helped development
  * Often around 4 hours per month-sprint (shorter sprints have shorter reviews)
* Daily Scrum
  * Members of the team meet at expected intervals—often daily, in the morning
  * All members describe:
    * What they did last day
    * What they plan to do today
    * If they currently have any roadblocks or _asks_ of other team members

#### Scrum team

* Scrum Master
  * Coach team members
  * Help Scrum team focus on high-value increments
  * Help remove roadblocks for the team
  * Ensure all Scrum events take place within the time limits
  * Helps with organizing of the project on all levels
* Developers
  * Plan a backlog, and the upcoming sprint
  * Finish anything they start to a launch-ready state
  * Each day is planned toward reaching the current sprint goal
* Product Owner
  * Develops a clear Product Goal
  * Creates / communicates Product Backlog Items
  * Ensures Product Backlog is transparent, visible, understood

#### Scrum Process

### Planning out a Project

#### Planning Steps

1. User Stories 
2. Resources (nouns from user stories)
3. ERD
4. Routes
5. Wireframe
6. Set up GitHub Together
7. Set up the Project Structure and Naming Conventions Together
8. Decide on Workflow and Tasks
9. Decide on Communication

* [Ruby Style-Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)
* [CSS Style-Guide](http://smacss.com/)

### Keeping Track of Tasks

#### Kanban

Kanban is a style of transparent communication across a team, detailing both the current and upcoming tasks and their progress. There are usually at least 3 columns on such a board:

1. Tasks Requiring Attention
2. In-Progress Work
3. Completed Work

Anyone visiting the board can immediately understand how much work is left, completed, and who is working on what (colour co-ordination and easy visual-indicators help observers understand at a glance).

#### Github Projects

Github has built-in Kanban-style boards called `Projects`. You can create Projects that cover multiple repos or you can create repo-specific projects. Issues and Pull Requests can be automatically added to the board and the board can be automated for things like code review.

### Keeping Track of Time

#### Time Estimation

* At the start this is difficult... how do you know how long something will take?
* The best way to get better is to **track your time**
* Consider the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and/or use of an [online Pomodoro timer](https://pomofocus.io/)
* Time tracking software
  * [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/)
  * [Tickspot](https://www.tickspot.com/)
  * Leave detailed notes or categorize your work
  * When quoting new projects you can review this to see how long on average these sorts of tasks have been taking
* With a good idea of how long things take, you can let yourself, your employer, and clients know how long things might take (add 10-20%+ in padding in case there is a complication)
* Don't fall victim to the [mythical man-month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#Ideas_presented)

#### Have a calendar!

* For meetings and core dates, it can be easy to double-book, miss something, or simply forget
* Use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) (or a similar app), it can notify you on your phone, in your e-mail, etc. about scheduled meetings and any changes—get in the habit of checking it often!

#### Have a schedule!

* Protect work-time and relaxation time
* You need focus-hours in the day where interruptions can be minimized
* Avoid social media and other distractions when working—sometimes it helps to have separate accounts on your OS, or two devices, one for work and one for leisure
* Have set times for relaxation to ensure you're taking breaks—protect an evening with the family, etc.

### Staying Organized

#### Take notes!
* Meeting, planning, research... these are all opportunities to make a note for later
* Tools

  * [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)
  * [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com)
  * [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

#### Know your favourite documentation
* There are tools for grabbing main / trusted docs in one-place for your convenience like [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)
* Going to do some work at the park? No internet there? No problem, grab an offline documenation tool (just remember to download the necessary docs before heading out!)
