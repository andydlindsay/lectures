### To Do

* [ ] Managing a Project
* [ ] The Planning Process
* [ ] Tools of the Trade
* [ ] Discuss!

### How are Projects Managed?

#### Waterfall

* A more "traditional" approach
* You quote and plan the project all at once and are set to that plan
* Each piece is worked on one at a time to ultimately launch the project at-once
* This could mean: discovery, design, wireframing, ERD, database, then back-end, then front-end, then styling, then a testing / fixes period
* Prone to roadblocks
* More solid initial planning
* Less flexible during development

#### Waterfall Release Schedule

#### Agile

* Iterative approach
* Dynamic
* Designed to deliver a product in smaller, faster "stages" / "sprints"
  * Sprints are defined periods of time (ex: 2 weeks) that a feature must be completed to a launch-ready point
* Each step of the way the progress and plan are re-evaluated and changes can be scheduled
* Has an emphasis on:
  * Individuals / interactions over processes and tools
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  * Responding to change over following a set plan

#### Scrum

* Teamwork framework
* [There are accepted schools of thought for SCRUM](https://scrumguides.org/)
* Product Backlog
  * A living document, an ordered list of what is needed to improve the topic
  * This defines the goals and work of the scrum team to reach the product goal
* Sprint Backlog
  * The list of deliverables / tasks necessary to fulfill items in the product backlog
  * Organized into groups that are deliverable within sprint-periods / sprints
* Sprint Planning
  * Why is the Sprint valuable?
  * What can be done during this sprint?
  * How will this get done, and by whom?
  * Set timeframe
* Sprint Execution
  * No changes can be made that endanger the sprint and its goals
  * Quality of the product can not decrease
  * Product backlog can be updated to reflect this development
  * Scope is clarified with the product owner as more is learned
  * Must complete within the agreed upon timeframe, all members are accountable and help each other
* Sprint Review
  * Look over the outcome of the sprint
  * Identify any adjustments or future developments that can improve it over time
  * Identify anything in the development process that hindered, or helped development
  * Often around 4 hours per month-sprint (shorter sprints have shorter reviews)
* Daily Scrum
  * Members of the team meet at expected intervals—often daily, in the morning
  * All members describe:
    * What they did last day
    * What they plan to do today
    * If they currently have any roadblocks
* Scrum team:
  * Scrum Master:
    * Coach team members
    * Help Scrum team focus on high-value increments
    * Help remove roadblocks for the team
    * Ensure all Scrum events take place within the time limits
    * Helps with organizing of the project on all levels
  * Developers:
    * Plan a backlog, and the upcoming sprint
    * Finish anything they start to a launch-ready state
    * Each day is planned toward reaching the current sprint goal
  * Product Owner:
    * Develops a clear Product Goal
    * Creates / communicates Product Backlog Items
    * Ensures Product Backlog is transparent, visible, understood

#### Scrum Process

![Scrum Process](https://www.pm-partners.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-scrum-process-opt.jpg)

### Planning out a Project

1. User Stories (Extract Nouns / Tables)
2. Database (Identify Relationships)
3. ERD (Consider use of Draw.IO or Vizio)
4. Routes
5. Wireframes (Consider use of Figma) [and Design]
6. Set up GitHub Together
7. Set up the Project Structure and Naming Conventions Together (Consider a Style-Guide for [JavaScript](https://airbnb.io/javascript/) / [Ruby](https://rubystyle.guide/) / [CSS](http://smacss.com/))
8. Decide on Workflow and Tasks (Consider use of [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira))
9. Communication ([Slack](https://slack.com/), E-Mail, [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com))

### Kanban

Kanban is a style of transparent communication across a team, detailing both the current and upcoming tasks and their progress. There are usually at least 3 columns on such a board:

1. Tasks Requiring Attention
2. In-Progress Work
3. Completed Work

Anyone visiting the board can immediately understand how much work is left, completed, and who is working on what (colour co-ordination and easy visual-indicators help observers understand at a glance).

### Keeping Track of Time

#### Time Estimation

* At the start this is difficult... how do you know how long something will take?
* Leave your judgement at the door, and begin *tracking your time*
* [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/), [Tickspot](https://www.tickspot.com/), [Alternatives?](https://alternativeto.net/software/tickspot/)
  * Leave detailed notes or categorize your work
  * When quoting new projects you can review this to see how long on average these sorts of tasks have been taking
* With a good idea of how long things take, you can let yourself, your employer, and clients know how long things might take (add 10-20%+ in padding in case there is a complication)
* Don't fall victim to the [mythical man-month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#Ideas_presented)


#### Have a calendar!

* For meetings and core dates, it can be easy to double-book, miss something, or simply forget
* Use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) (or a similar app), it can notify you on your phone, in your e-mail, etc. about scheduled meetings and any changes—get in the habit of checking it often!

#### Have a schedule!
* Protect work-time and relaxation time
* You need focus-hours in the day where interruptions can be minimized
* Avoid social media and other distractions when working—sometimes it helps to have separate accounts on your OS, or two devices, one for work and one for leisure
* Have set times for relaxation to ensure you're taking breaks—protect an evening with the family, etc.
* Still having trouble focusing? Consider the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and use of [online timers](https://pomofocus.io/):
  1. Decide on a task
  2. Work on the task for ~25 minutes
  3. Take a break (5-10 minutes)
  4. Repeat the above 3 times
  5. Take a 20-30 minute break and return to step 1

### Organization

#### Take notes!
* Meeting, planning, research... these are all opportunities to make a note for later
* Tools: [EverNote](https://evernote.com/), [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)

#### Know your favourite documentation
* There are tools for grabbing main / trusted docs in one-place for your convenience like [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)
* Going to do some work at the park? No internet there? No problem, grab an offline documenation tool (just remember to download the necessary docs before heading out!)
  * MacOS: [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)
  * Windows: [Velocity](https://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/)
  * Linux: [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/)
