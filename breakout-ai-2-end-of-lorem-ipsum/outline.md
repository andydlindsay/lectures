### Case Study #1 - Generating content for JavaScript

```
Generate some example programming questions

Generate some programming questions based on this format
```

### Case Study #2 - Generating HTML skeletons

```
Generate three HTML paragraphs inside a div

I want an HTML file that contains a brief intro to a physics blog. There should be three featured posts. At the bottom of the page, before the footer, there should be a basic newsletter sign-up form.
```

### Case Study #3 - Generating SQL seed data

```
Please give me a list of movie titles from the last few years

Could you rewrite the above list as an SQL insert statement? The table has the fields: id, movie_title, release_year. The table is called movies.

Could you write them again as individual insert statements? And maybe only 10 or so (I don't need too many).
```

### Case Study #4 - Generating test suites

```
Can you write some tests cases (including edge cases) for this JavaScript function? I'd like to use Mocha and Chai (assertions only please).

const sayHello = (name, timeOfDay) => {
  if (timeOfDay > 12) {
    return `good afternoon ${name}`;
  }

  return `hello there ${name}`
};
```
