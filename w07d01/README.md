### Review of Closures
- From MDN:
> A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the **lexical environment**). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function **creation** time.
- In other words, functions remember where they were declared and what variables were in scope (they had access to) at the time they were declared
- This allows us to preserve _state_ in between function calls (subsequent calls to the function can use the updated state value)
- Contrasting with JS Classes (how we used to create React components): components as objects were instantiated from a Class and it was the same object that was used over and over again. Therefore it always had access to its own internal state. Functional components need some way of creating a _closure_ so that we can achieve the same result.
- Enter `useState` (and other `use` functions) which keep track of state for us between function calls and allow us to retrieve and edit variables every time the function is invoked (eg. the component is created/updated)

### React
- From the landing page of [React](https://reactjs.org/):
  > A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Open source project maintained by Facebook
- React is built around the concept of managing data
  - Changes to the underlying data result in changes to the UI
  - In React, state === data
- Component-based: UI is composed of small pieces
- Declarative: We describe the final outcome of our code and not the step-by-step process to achieve that result

### Components
- Components are the building blocks of a webpage (eg. search input, navigation bar, contact us form)
- Ideally, components should be reusable (which means that their state should be passed into them via props rather than maintaining their own state)
- Deciding which DOM elements become components and which don't is a skill that comes with practice and experience
- We will be building all of our components using functions
- The functions return value contains a mixture of HTML and JS; React calls this `JSX`

```jsx
// basic component
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className="my-component">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Passing Props
- Child components can be passed pieces of state (data) from their parent component
- These props are accepted in the child component as an argument (usually called `props`)

```jsx
// in parent component
import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent.jsx';

// inside the parent's return
<MyComponent studentName="Alice"></MyComponent>

// inside child component
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello { props.studentName }!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

- Props are not limited to JS primitives and data structures; you can also pass behaviour from parent-to-child in the form of functions

### Storybook
- From the [Storybook Docs](https://storybook.js.org/):
> Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular.
- Allows us to develop our components separate from each other (isolation)
- Builds out a component library so new devs on the team can come up to speed quickly
- Can show various different ways to render each component based on props passed in
