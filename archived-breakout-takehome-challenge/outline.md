### Intro (30 minutes)

- overview of take home challenges

- why take home challenges are better
  - they allow you to spend as much time as you need to perfect the code
  - you are working in a comfortable environment on your own terms without someone watching your every move
  - they are a better showcase of your problem solving skills
  - the challenge will be practical rather than cs interview questions
  - you have the time to research new technologies/frameworks/libraries
  - you get a feel for the kind of work that you will be doing day-to-day (KV example)
  - you don't have to miss work like you would for a multi-hour whiteboarding interview
  - you can go above and beyond
  - you may be able to add it to your portfolio (always ask first); at the very least, it's green on github (contributions to private repos still show up in your github contributions)

- drawbacks
  - time
  - you will lose at least an evening/weekend vs a one and done interview
  - you might have to get an app in an unfamiliar framework up and running from scratch which can be incredibly time consuming

- basic types of take home challenges
  - front-end challenges (build a user interface, display data from an external api, build a game)
  - full-stack challenge (build an entire application or serve data from another api)
  - back-end challenge (build an api possibly backed by data)

- mistakes to avoid
  - the challenge is beyond your current skillset
  - you just don't have the time to complete the challenge or to the degree that you would like
  - multiple challenges mean learning multiple new things (possibly too many new things at once)
  - submitting sloppy code (use a linter)
  - lack of upfront planning

- planning
  - understand the requirements and ask appropriate questions
  - identify what/if any technical decisions you get to make
  - testing?
  - work incrementally/break the problem down and set an order for the tasks to be completed
  - use a digital planner such as Trello or Github projects

- final thoughts
  - make it work
  - make it pretty
  - make it fast
  - be prepared to discuss the code that you've written (copy and paste)
  - ask yourself what the employer is looking to get out of the challenge
  - focus on the MVP before moving on to stretch
  - Review the requirements and make sure that you have met all of them

### Group Activity (20 minutes)

### Wrap Up && Reflect (10 minutes)

- time for questions and recap of various approaches
- Writing automated tests or talking about why you didn't have time to do them but how you’d approach them
- If you’re not going to be able to start it ASAP or will take longer than x days to get back to them, communicate this
- If you have questions about the scope, how do you approach that?
