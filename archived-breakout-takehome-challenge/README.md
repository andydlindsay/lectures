## W11D4 Tackle the Take Home Challenge

### Why Take Home Challenges Rock!

* They allow you to spend as much time as you need (within the deadline given) to perfect your code
* You can work in a comfortable environment on your terms without someone watching your every move
* Opportunity to showcase your problem solving skills
* The challenge is usually practical not just computer science interview questions
* You'll get a feel for the kind of work that you will be doing on a daily basis
* You don't have to miss work like you would for a multi-hour white-boarding interview
* You can go above and beyond the requirements
* You may be able to publically display the challenge in your portfolio/github (always ask the employer first!); at the very least, it's green on github (contributions to private repos still show up in your github contributions)
* You get to use a computer!

### The Cons

* Time! Beware of scope creep and make sure to timebox yourself
* You might have to get an app in an unfamiliar framework up and running from scratch which can be incredibly time consuming
* You don't get a sense of the mentorship you will receive on the job

### Basic Types of Take Home Challenges

* Front-end Challenge (eg. build a user interface, display data from an external api, build a game in the browser)
* Full-stack Challenge (eg. build an entire application from the ground up, serve data from another api)
* Back-end Challenge (eg. build an api, create a database and tables)

### Mistakes to Avoid

* Make sure that the challenge is within your current skillset and communicate with the employer if you think it's beyond you (currently)
* Manage your time and communicate with the employer if you think that you won't be able to complete the challenge by the deadline
* Taking on multiple challenges can mean learning multiple new things (possibly too many new things at once)
* Submitting sloppy code (use a linter!)
* Lack of upfront planning

### Planning

* Understand the requirements and ask appropriate questions
* Identify what (if any) technical decisions you get to make
* Come up with a testing plan (manual, unit, integration, etc)
* Work incrementally/break the problem down into smaller tasks and set an order for the tasks to be completed
* Use a digital planner such as Trello or Github Projects

### Final Thoughts

* Make it work (focus on the MVP) before moving on to stretch
* Review the requirements and make sure that you have met all of them
* Be prepared to discuss the code that you have written (beware copy and paste Stack Overflow answers)
* Ask yourself what the employer is looking to get out of the challenge
