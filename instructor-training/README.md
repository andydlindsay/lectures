# Instructor Training

### Lecture Preparation
* Use the notes/planning of other instructors (don't let pride detract from user experience)
* Watch the lectures of other instructors (2x speed); steal their ideas/jokes
* Walk through your lecture code a few days/hours before lecture; libraries can change versions and you don't want to be caught out
* Review the curriculum surrounding the lecture; consider working common bugs/things to watch out for into your lecture
* 

### Setup
* Minimize background distractions; consider purchasing a green screen
* Minimize additional audio in your area (keyboard sounds, mouse clicks, people talking, pets making noise); consider purchasing Krisp
* Clean up your desktop: close unnecessary tabs/applications, remove shortcut icons, minimize number of icons on task bar, hide/remove browser extensions, hide bookmark bar
* Turn off notifications and anything else that might pop up embarrassingly/distractingly during lecture (eg. bouncing app notifications on Mac)
* 

### Lecture Delivery
* Slide decks are less engaging than live-coding
* Zoom your screen/text; consider a student watching on a tablet (worst case scenario)
* Highlight the code/documentation/error message that you are currently reading
* Add occasional SFW humour/jokes; laughter helps with engagement and keeps the students from getting bored (hopefully)
* Keep an eye on chat and participants list (2+ screens is helpful); lectures should be a conversation
* Be genuine; lectures aren't to show off/impress, they are to clarify topics and answer questions
* Use the terminal app or equivalent; do not use the built-in VS Code terminal (students who replicate this behaviour sometimes get weird bugs)
* Dark mode! The students want it! Dark Reader is a Chrome extension that provides dark mode on any website
* We need to help the students make connections to what they already know; new topics are never 100% new ("this is just like when you did x in week y")
* Repeat chat questions for the recording/users who don't have the chat open
* Be excited for the topic! Even if you don't feel it
* 

### Post-Lecture Review
* Rewatch your lectures
* Put yourself in the place of the student; audio quality, video quality, text size, clarity of instruction, number of "uh's and um's"
* Pay attention to the questions that were asked during lecture; students in future cohorts will have the same questions and you can work that into your lecture
* Lecture planning is never fully done (WIP)
