### Introduction to Vue.js
* Progressive framework: you can plug it in to just a part of your application
* Smaller size compared to other front-end frameworks
* Component-based
* Reactive: when the data changes, the view re-renders

### Installation
* Use `vite` directly or use the `vue` builder tool
* `vue` gives more specific Vue options while `vite` is more generic

```bash
# using vite
npm create vite@latest app-name

# using vue
npm create vue@latest app-name
```
