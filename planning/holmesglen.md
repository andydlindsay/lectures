# Web Development Bootcamp

### JavaScript
* The language of the web
* The most popular programming language in the world

### Node.js
* Node allows us to write JavaScript on the backend/server-side
* We can teach full-stack development with one language

### HTML & CSS
* The building blocks of the web
* We'll teach you how to structure and style a website using modern CSS including flexbox and SASS

### Automated Testing
* Software testing gives us confidence in the code that we write
* It's proof that we have satisfied business logic or design criteria
* Manual testing (paying someone to actually use the code) is expensive and time consuming
* We'll cover static, unit, integration, and end-to-end testing using various different testing libraries

### Software Architecture
* How you structure an application is incredibly important
* And the solution is often customized to the problem
* We'll show you various ways to structure web apps and cover best practices

### Responsive Design
* More and more users are choosing to consume the internet through mobile devices like phones and tablets
* Responsive design means that our websites look great on a variety of devices/screen sizes

### Databases and Data Modelling
* Databases allow us to store data in a safe and organized way
* This structured, organized data allows us to ask questions (eg. what's the most popular song, how many days in a row has the user logged in)

### Ruby on Rails
* An important part of the bootcamp is simulating a real-world development environment
* We have chosen to use Ruby on Rails for our real-world simulation weeks
* You'll use a language and framework you are unfamiliar with to add features to a partially finished app... just like the real world

### Computer Science Fundamentals
* Most Fridays in bootcamp are Fundamental Fridays where we cover computer science fundamentals like algorithms, recursion, object-oriented programming, and explore advanced data structures such as trees and stacks

# Our Three Pillars

### Application Development
* We cover it from the ground up
* We'll teach you how to build a backend, style out a frontend, and store data in a database
* Using modern frameworks and libraries such as functional React
* Coding best practices to write clean/clear code
* Two team projects and various opportunities for pair programming because programming is a team sport
* We'll teach you how to understand every line of code that you write

### Computer Science
* While most of the bootcamp is focused on hands-on learning, it's also important to understand the theory behind the practice
* Plus, it will help you get ready for job interviews :)
* We'll cover: 
  * Computer science fundamentals
  * Whiteboard/technical interview practice and advice
  * And practice coding challenges (aka katas)

### Software Engineering Principles
* Solid understanding of how modern apps are built and best practices for writing code
* Test Driven Development, write our tests before we write our code
* Security: we'll show you the most common ways that websites get hacked and how to protect your site
* Version control
  * Retrace our steps if something goes wrong
  * Attribute each line written to a particular person
  * Remote storage of our code for safety and collaboration
