### To Do
* [ ] Types of Interviews
* [ ] Types of Questions
* [ ] Problem Solving Process
* [ ] Online Practice
* [ ] Example prompts
* [ ] Interview Review

### Types of Interviews
* Culture fit - a meeting to get to know you and your personality to see if you'll work well with the current team
* White board - no VS Code, no autocomplete, just you and a marker vs the problem
* Take home challenge - you are provided with a small project to complete before a deadline (usually 1 - 4 days)
* Pair programming - working with the interviewer to solve a problem

### Types of Questions
* Technical Experience
  * Recall a time when you exhibited X quality
  * What sort of experience do you have with X?
  * If you were to experience X error, how would you troubleshoot it?
* Coding challenge
  * Write code that solves a particular problem
* Code review
  * Read the code provided and explain what it does or how it could be improved
  * Review code from one of your previous projects with the interviewer

### Problem Solving Process
* Vocalize your thoughts and decision making process
* Have you seen this type of question before?
* Break the problem down into smaller pieces
* Use pseudocode/write down the problem solving steps
* Work incrementally towards the goal
* Ask clarifying questions
  * Confirm the inputs (eg. how many arguments, argument types)
  * Confirm the output (eg. console.log or return?)
  * Clarify functionality (eg. happy path only? edge cases to consider? how to handle errors?)
  * Clarify expected syntax (eg. can I use pseudocode? does the code need to run?)
* Don't be afraid to say "I don't know"
* Discuss alternate solutions/how this code could be improved

### Online Practice

* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

### Interview Review
* Did anything unexpected happen? (eg. a word/term you'd never heard or a question you'd never seen)
* What went well? What parts of the interview were you happiest with?
* What went poorly? What parts of the interview could be improved on?
* Based on your interaction with the interviewer, is this an employer you'd like to work for?
