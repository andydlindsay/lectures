/* Question 03

Implement the function as defined below.

Many programming languages have a range() functionality which will generate an array of numbers that increment from either 0 or 1 up to the number of digits requested. For example, range(10) might return [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] or it might return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] depending on the implementation. Some even allow you to control the direction.

Unfortunately, JavaScript doesn't have a built-in range() function, so we want you to build one. Build out the function range() so that it takes three parameters:

1. The number of integers to generate
2. A boolean for whether to skip 0 or not (true: skip zero)
3. A boolean for whether the range should be in reverse/decreasing order or regular/increasing order (true: reverse/decreasing order)

If a non-number is passed in for the first argument, return an empty array.

Pro Tip: Remember to work incrementally. Start off just implementing the false and false scenario for the second and third parameters. In other words, focus on the zero-based, ascending range first. Work on edge cases at the very end (such as passing in a string instead of a number, as shown in the final example below.)

**Examples:**

- range(10, false, false) should return [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
- range(10, true, false) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- range(10, true, true) should return [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
- range(10, false, true) should return [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
- range(3, true, false) should return [1, 2, 3]
- range(0, false, <anything>) should return [0]
- range(10) should do the same thing as range(10, false, false)
- range(10, true) should do the same thing as range(10, true, false)
- range("2", <anything>, <anything>) should return []

const range = function(count, skipZero, descending) {

};

// Don't change below:

module.exports = { range };
